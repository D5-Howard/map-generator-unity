# About
![Image of Generated Map](https://github.com/D5-Howard/map-generator-unity/blob/master/Readme/demo.gif)

This project was fork from Voronoi Map Generator,and I add some another function just like GPUInstance Grass supported,auto add vetex for bigger map,Porlin Noise Node map. It's just for learning.

Enjoy!

# Voronoi Map Generator
A Unity implementation of a map generator which this project forked from using a similar process to the
one outlined by [Amit Patel at Red Blob Games](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/)

It produces maps like this:
