# About This Project
![Image of Generated Map](https://github.com/D5-Howard/map-generator-unity/blob/master/Readme/demo.gif)

This project was fork from Voronoi Map Generator,and I add some another function just like GPUInstance Grass supported,auto add vetex for bigger map,Porlin Noise Node map. It's just for learning.

Enjoy!

# What's the next
I am still keep developing this project.Maybe there will have some problem in this project.^^

Next step:

1.add a real player into this screen.

2.make full grass,not just in vertex.

3.auto build trees and creatures

It produces maps like this:
